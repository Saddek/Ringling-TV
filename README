Ok, so there are some tricks to getting this setup.

1. Bootstrap the project with python bootstrap.py
2. Run bin/buildout
3. Wait for buildout to download the fedora installer (as needed)
4. Run bin/install_fedora

Once setup, you can start the fedora server via bin/start_fedora

Next, configure your myproject/local_settings.py

You'll have to make sure ffmpeg and ffmpeg2theora are installed and their paths are configured in your settings (as RTV_FFMPEG, and RTV_FFMPEG2THEORA).
You'll also have to make sure your MEDIA_URL is fully qualified (protocol://host..., eg http://localhost:8000/static/ for the local dev server).

Once the config is setup, you should be able to run bin/test to confirm everything is in order.
