Ok, so there are some tricks to getting this setup.

1. Bootstrap the project with python bootstrap.py
2. Run bin/buildout
3. Copy java-dependencies to the "parts" directory (should give parts/java-dependencies/...)
4. Run bin/install_fedora

Once setup, you can start the fedora server via ./start-fedora.bash
After that you can start your django app server.

Don't forget to configure your myproject/local_settings.py before you runserver though!
